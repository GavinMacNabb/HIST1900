OpenAI - Summary
This keynote speech argued that the predominant form of the social web is an impoverished model for learning and research, and that our survival as a species depends on us getting past it. It introduced two terms representing different approaches to the Web: The Garden and the Stream. The Garden is an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another, while the Stream is a single, time ordered path with our experience at the center. It discussed how tools like federated wiki could be used to create a distributed garden of knowledge, and raised ethical questions about how much time people spend arguing their points rather than contributing to the general pool of knowledge. The speaker concluded by suggesting that there may be signs of a shift towards garden technologies, and that we can imagine a world so much better than this one if only we can get our heads out of the Stream for a bit, and build the Garden we need.

Summary | *The Garden and the Stream. A Technoplastoral* 
This speech argued that the internet is mainly a social web for learning and research, but as a species we need to get past this old model and move forward. The speaker introduced two terms representing different approaches to how we see the web, The Garden and the Stream. The Garden is an arranegemt of relationships between things and the Stream is a single, time ordered path with our experience in the middle of it. It discussed tools to help build gardens of knowledge and raised the question why people spend so much time arguing over if theyre right than contributing to the poll of knowledge. Itconcludes that there may be a sign of a shift towards these technologies, but we can imagine a world so much better if we contribute to these garden communities.
