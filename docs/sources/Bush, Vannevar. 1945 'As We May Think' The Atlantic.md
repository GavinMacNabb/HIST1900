Vannevar Bush wrote an article in 1945 titled "As We May Think" in which he proposed a device called a "memex" which would be an enlarged supplement to an individual's memory. He discussed advances in technology such as photocells, advanced photography, thermionic tubes, cathode ray tubes, and relay combinations which could help transform scientific records. He also discussed the potential of microphotography, authors talking directly to the record, and machines performing repetitive thought processes. The memex consists of a desk with slanting translucent screens, a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. It would allow for books, pictures, periodicals, newspapers, and business correspondence to be obtained and dropped into place. Bush also proposed the development of new languages to better fit the technique for transmitting and recording speech. He envisioned new forms of encyclopedias with associative trails running through them.
